# Task: Change Carousel Arrows to Green

## Steps from Approved Plan

1. [x] Edit styles.css: Remove hue-rotate filter from .carousel-control-prev and .carousel-control-next to prevent color alteration.
2. [x] Edit styles.css: Reinforce color: #28a745 !important; on .carousel-control-prev .fs-1 and .carousel-control-next .fs-1 with higher specificity if needed.
3. [x] Edit styles.css: Ensure .carousel-control-prev-icon and .carousel-control-next-icon have background: none; to avoid icon interference with text spans.
4. [x] Test the changes by launching index.html in browser and verifying arrow color via screenshot.
5. [x] Update TODO.md with completion status.
6. [x] Fix text overlapping by adjusting carousel control width and inner padding.
